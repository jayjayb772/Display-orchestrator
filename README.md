# What is this?
The orchestrator for all the microservices for the display board!

## Where is it being hosted???
Good try, I'm not putting the API link here, silly! You can host it yourself! I will make a list of required environment variables soon!
I'm using digital ocean droplets though!


## Why'd you do this?
Because I never found a display board with enough customizability for me. Also I wanted to make a microservice based API on my own and I never really had the chance to learn react
